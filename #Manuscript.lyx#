Soil redox potential measurements can be done without much physical effort
 in a short amount of time, whereas measuring benthos species diversity
 involves more effort and time.
 This study explored if soil redox potential can be used as a sole predictor
 of the abundance of benthos species.
 Both variables were measured at an intertidal zone at Schiermonnikoog at
 a transect from salt marsh to mudflat

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Inundation was expected to be influential in species composition, and to
 correct for this, benthos species and redox values were obtained from two
 depths at each site.
 It was found that redox potential alone cannot be used as predictor of
 species composition.

Make sure to write a clear introduction that logically fits with the abstract
 that you wrote, that follows the "hourglass" structure.
 Keep for each section in the introduction approximately the same length
 as used in your example papers (use your outlines).
 Also include some references in your introduction.

 Justification
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Species composition is one of the first and most vital pieces of data a
 field-based ecological research needs to gather.
 Any way to reliably conclude the same information with less work will save
 researchers both time and resources.
 One piece of information that is easy to obtain is a soil its redox potential.
 Redox potential is not just a passive abiotic factor; it is a value is
 of biological importance instead.
 Among others, redox potential can be a measure of oxygen in the soil, and
 it is known that plant roots can raise the oxygen level in the soil (and
 thus its redox potential)

.
 This positive correlation, however, is not always correct, because at least
 one other study finds a negative correlation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "DongEtAl2014"

\end_inset

.
 As far as I know, using redox potential as a predictor of species being
 present or not, has not yet been investigated.
 It might be so, because no relation is expected.
 Would this relation be found, those expectations were incorrect.

 Hypothesis
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study investigates if soil redox potential can be used as a sole predictor
 of benthos species abundance.
 Or: would it be that some species abundances are distributed normally around
 a certain redox potential?

This study was carried out at the intertidal zone of Schiermonnikoog.
 In the Southwest of this island, a 2400 meter long transect was set up,
 from salt marsh to mudflat.
 The elevations of the transect range from 270 cm to -80 cm NAP.
 All measurements were done at September 9th and 10th.
 At those days, inundation times of the sample sites ranged from from 1-80%
 of a tidal period.

Redox values
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Redox values were measured by a potentiometer using 4 platinum-tip electrodes
 and a solution of KCl as a reference.
 The electrodes were put in at two depths: 2 cm and 10 cm, in this sequence.
 The potential read is the value that remained constant, when placing or
 changing the electrodes.
 The values read were transformed to use earth as a reference point, using
 the formula

Coupling redox values to soil depth
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, the redox potential at 2 cm depth is coupled to the benthos
 species diversity at depth 0-5 cm, where the potential at 10 cm depth is
 coupled to the diversity of depth 5-20 cm.

Selection of data to be analyzed
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of all collected species, only species with at least 3 individuals at both
 depths were taken into account.
 The minimum value of 3 was chosen, because it is the minimum number to
 test for normality.
 The requirement for a species to be at two depths is to disrupt the effect
 of inundation, as there can be similar redox potentials for different inundatio
n times.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each species, a Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to determine if
 abundance is distributed normally around a certain redox potential.
 This test is chosen, as it has the best power for a given significance

863 individuals of 18 different species were collected at the site (see
 figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 Of these species, 8 species had at least 3 individuals at both depths.
 Out of these 8 species, only 4 could be used, as not all sites had their
 redox potential measured.
 From the 4 species left, only the 2 species occurring at multiple redox
 potentials were analyzed.
 These two species were

 Figure

 A Shapiro-Wilk normality test shows that both species have a significant
 probability of not following a normal distribution (

Given a certain redox potential, the abundances of both

 As it does not live in the soil itself, nor does it feed on something in
 the soil itself, it is not surprising that also this species is unaffected
 by soil redox potential.

Coupling a redox potential at a single depth to species abundances at a
 range of depths may have been too much of a simplification.
 Redox potential changes when probing at different depths in the soil, but
 whether this change is monotonous was unknown before drawing the conclusions.
 Because in the experiments also the redox potential at 5 cm deep was measured,
 it could be tested that redox potential changes monotonously for depths
 2, 5 and 10 cm.
 It was found that this was the case in 10 out of 13 measurements (see table
