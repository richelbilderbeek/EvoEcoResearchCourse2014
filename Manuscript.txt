Soil redox potential as a predictor of endobenthos species 
composition in an intertidal zone

Richèl Bilderbeek

Abstract

Soil redox potential measurements can be done without much 
physical effort in a short amount of time, whereas measuring 
endobenthos species diversity involves more effort and time. This 
study explored if soil redox potential can be used as a sole 
predictor of the abundance of endobenthos. Both variables were 
measured at an intertidal zone at Schiermonnikoog at a transect 
from salt marsh to mudflat. Inundation was expected to be 
influential in species composition, and to correct for this, 
species abundances and redox values were obtained from two depths 
at each site. It was found that redox potential alone cannot be 
used as predictor of endobenthos composition.

  Introduction



Species composition is one of the first and most vital pieces of 
data a field-based ecological research needs to gather. Any way 
to reliably conclude the same information with less work will 
save researchers both time and resources. One piece of 
information that is easy to obtain is a soil its redox potential. 
Redox potential is not just a passive abiotic factor; it is a 
value of biological importance. Among others, redox potential can 
be a measure of oxygen in the soil, and it is known that plant 
roots can raise the oxygen level in the soil (and thus its redox 
potential) (Blossfeld et al. (2011)). This positive correlation, 
however, is not always correct, because at least one other study 
finds a negative correlation (Dong et al. (2014)). As far as I 
know, using redox potential as a predictor of bethos species 
being present or not, has not yet been investigated. 

As redox potential is positively correlated with soil oxygen 
concentration, and all animals need oxygen for respiration, I 
expect some benthos animals to respond to soil redox potential. 
The most likely candidates are animals that live in the soil and 
breathe through their skin, as these animals might choke from a 
too low oxygen concentration and will probably move to a habitat 
with a higher oxygen concentration instead. Additionally, it 
might be that microbenthos serving as prey aggregrates at a 
certain oxygen concentration, which might cause its predator to 
follow this distribution.



The hypothesis tested is if soil redox potential can be used as a 
sole predictor of endobenthos species abundance, when assuming 
species distribute themselves normally around a certain redox 
potential. This study makes a strong case that this hypothesis 
should be rejected.

  Material and methods



This study was carried out at the intertidal zone of 
Schiermonnikoog. In the Southwest of this island, a 2400 meter 
long transect was set up, from salt marsh to mudflat. The 
elevations of the transect range from 270 cm to -80 cm NAP. All 
measurements were done at September 9th and 10th. At those days, 
inundation times of the sample sites ranged from from 1-80% of a 
tidal period.



Soil samples of 20 cm deep were taken at different distances. The 
top 5 cm was separated. Both parts of the soil sample were scored 
for species. 



Redox values were measured by a potentiometer using 4 
platinum-tip electrodes and a solution of KCl as a reference. The 
electrodes were put in at three depths: 2, 5 and 10 cm, in this 
sequence. The potential read is the value that remained constant, 
when placing or changing the electrodes. The values read were 
transformed to use earth as a reference point, using the formula V=1.8847\cdot V_{measured}-53.201

.



In this study, the redox potential at 2 cm depth is coupled to 
the benthos species diversity at depth 0-5 cm, where the 
potential at 10 cm depth is coupled to the diversity of depth 
5-20 cm.



Of all collected species, only species with at least 3 
individuals at both depths were taken into account. The minimum 
value of 3 was chosen, because it is the minimum number to test 
for normality. The requirement for a species to be at two depths 
is to disrupt the effect of inundation, as there can be similar 
redox potentials for different inundation times. 



For each species, a Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to 
determine if abundance is distributed normally around a certain 
redox potential. This test is chosen, as it has the best power 
for a given significance (Razali and Wah (2011)).



The script to analyze the data is written in R and can be

  Results

The redox potentials measured can be seen in figure [fig:RedoxPerDistance]
.

863 individuals of 18 different benthos species were collected at 
the site (see figure [table_species_count_at_depth]). Of these 
species, 8 species had at least 3 individuals at both depths. Out 
of these 8 species, only 4 could be used, as not all sites were 
measured for redox potential. From the 4 species left, only the 2 
species occurring at multiple redox potentials were analyzed. 
These two species were Hydrobia ulvae and Nereis diversicolor. 
Figure [fig:SpeciesAbundances] shows the abundance of both 
species at different redox potentials. A Shapiro-Wilk normality 
test shows that both species have a significant probability of 
not following a normal distribution (p_{Hydrobia}<0.001
, p_{Nereis}<0.05

, see table [tab:NormalityTest] for exact values).

  Discussion

This study makes a strong case that soil redox potential cannot 
be used to predict species abundances, for both Hydrobia ulvae 
and Nereis diversicolor. 

As Hydrobia ulvae is an epibenthic grazer (Newell (1965)), it 
seems rather obvious that is not influenced by the oxygen level 
of the soil underneath it. Less obvious is that individuals were 
found in benthos 5 cm below the surface. This finding appears not 
to be an experimental error, as Hydrobia ulvae is found in deeper 
soil samples at multiple distances. It might be that the Hydrobia 
ulvae found in the deeper soil were not individuals, but only the 
shells left.

Nereis diversicolor creates burrows in the mud and is a predator 
and scavanger (Witte and Wilde de (1979)). As it does not live in 
the soil itself, nor does it feed on something in the soil 
itself, it is not surprising that also this species is unaffected 
by soil redox potential.

Coupling a redox potential at a single depth to species 
abundances at a range of depths may have been too much of a 
simplification. Redox potential changes when probing at different 
depths in the soil, but whether this change is monotonous was 
unknown. After drawing the conclusions, the change of redox 
potential was analyzed for its orderedness. Because in the 
experiments also the redox potential at 5 cm deep was measured, 
it could be tested if redox potential changes monotonously for 
depths 2, 5 and 10 cm. It was found that this was the case in 10 
out of 13 locations (see table [tab:Orderedness]). Thus, in 3 out 
of 13 cases, the redox potential at intermediate depth was the 
heighest or lowest value measured at that location. There can be 
two explanations for this unexpected pattern: (1) the soil redox 
potential is a complex abiotic variable that does not follow a 
monotonic change, or (2) the noise in the redox measurement is 
higher than the change in 'true' redox potential between depths.
