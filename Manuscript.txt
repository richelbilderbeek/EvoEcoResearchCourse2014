Soil redox potential as a predictor of benthos species 
composition in an intertidal zone

Richel Bilderbeek

Abstract

Soil redox potential measurements can be done without much 
physical effort in a short amount of time. Measuring benthos 
species diversity involves more effort and time. This study 
examines the use of soil redox potential to predict the abundance 
of benthos species. The measurements are taken at an intertidal 
zone at Schiermonnikoog, at a transect from salt marsh to muflat. 
Benthos species and redox values were obtained from two depths, 
so that the effect of inundation can be estimated. It was found 
that redox potential alone is a better predictor of species 
composition than inundation time, allowing these findings to be 
extended to other ecosystems.

  Introduction



Species composition is one of the first and most vital pieces of 
data a field-based ecological research needs to gather. Any way 
to reliably conclude the same information with less work will 
save researchers both time and resources. 

  Materials and method



Soil samples of 20 cm deep were taken at different distances. The 
top 5 cm was seperated. Both parts of the soil sample were scored 
for species. 



Redox values were measured by a potentiometer using 4 
platinum-tip electrodes and a solution of KCl as a reference. The 
electrodes were put in at two depths: 2 cm and 10 cm, in this 
sequence. The potential read is the value that remained constant, 
when placing or changing the electrodes. The values read were 
transformed to use earth as a reference point.



Of the 18 species scored, only species with at least 3 
individuals (the minimum to test for normality) at both depths 
were analyzed using niche theory.



For each species, a Chi-squared goodness-of-fit was used to 
determine if abundance is distributed normally around a certain 
redox potential.  

  Results

Of the 18 species scored, 8 species had at least 3 individuals at 
both depths. Out of these 8 species, only 4 could be used, as not 
all sites had their redox potential measured. From the 4 species 
left, only the 2 species occurring at multiple redox potentials 
were analyzed.
