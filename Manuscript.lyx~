\begin_layout Abstract
Soil redox potential measurements can be done without much physical effort
 in a short amount of time, whereas measuring endobenthos species diversity
 involves more effort and time.
 This study explored if soil redox potential can be used as a sole predictor
 of the abundance of endobenthos.
 Both variables were measured at an intertidal zone at Schiermonnikoog at
 a transect from salt marsh to mudflat.
 Inundation was expected to be influential in species composition, and to
 correct for this, species abundances and redox values were obtained from
 two depths at each site.
 It was found that redox potential alone cannot be used as predictor of
 endobenthos composition.

 Justification
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Species composition is one of the first and most vital pieces of data a
 field-based ecological research needs to gather.
 Any way to reliably conclude the same information with less work will save
 researchers both time and resources.
 One piece of information that is easy to obtain is a soil its redox potential.
 Redox potential is not just a passive abiotic factor; it is a value of
 biological importance.
 Among others, redox potential can be a measure of oxygen in the soil, and
 it is known that plant roots can raise the oxygen level in the soil (and
 thus its redox potential) (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Blossfeld2011"

\end_inset

).
 This positive correlation, however, is not always correct, because at least
 one other study finds a negative correlation (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dong2014"

\end_inset

).
 As far as I know, using redox potential as a predictor of bethos species
 being present or not, has not yet been investigated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As redox potential is positively correlated with soil oxygen concentration,
 and all animals need oxygen for respiration, I expect some benthos animals
 to respond to soil redox potential.
 The most likely candidates are animals that live in the soil and breathe
 through their skin, as these animals might choke from a too low oxygen
 concentration and will probably move to a habitat with a higher oxygen
 concentration instead.
 Additionally, it might be that microbenthos serving as prey aggregrates
 at a certain oxygen concentration, which might cause its predator to follow
 this distribution.

 Hypothesis
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hypothesis tested is if soil redox potential can be used as a sole predictor
 of endobenthos species abundance, when assuming species distribute themselves
 normally around a certain redox potential.
 This study makes a strong case that this hypothesis should be rejected.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study was carried out at the intertidal zone of Schiermonnikoog.
 In the Southwest of this island, a 2400 meter long transect was set up,
 from salt marsh to mudflat.
 The elevations of the transect range from 270 cm to -80 cm NAP.
 All measurements were done at September 9th and 10th.
 At those days, inundation times of the sample sites ranged from from 1-80%
 of a tidal period.

Redox values
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Redox values were measured by a potentiometer using 4 platinum-tip electrodes
 and a solution of KCl as a reference.
 The electrodes were put in at three depths: 2, 5 and 10 cm, in this sequence.
 The potential read is the value that remained constant, when placing or
 changing the electrodes.
 The values read were transformed to use earth as a reference point, using
 the formula

Coupling redox values to soil depth
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, the redox potential at 2 cm depth is coupled to the benthos
 species diversity at depth 0-5 cm, where the potential at 10 cm depth is
 coupled to the diversity of depth 5-20 cm.

Selection of data to be analyzed
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of all collected species, only species with at least 3 individuals at both
 depths were taken into account.
 The minimum value of 3 was chosen, because it is the minimum number to
 test for normality.
 The requirement for a species to be at two depths is to disrupt the effect
 of inundation, as there can be similar redox potentials for different inundatio
n times.

Statistics
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each species, a Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to determine if
 abundance is distributed normally around a certain redox potential.
 This test is chosen, as it has the best power for a given significance

\begin_layout Standard
863 individuals of 18 different benthos species were collected at the site
 (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "table_species_count_at_depth"

\end_inset

).
 Of these species, 8 species had at least 3 individuals at both depths.
 Out of these 8 species, only 4 could be used, as not all sites were measured
 for redox potential.
 From the 4 species left, only the 2 species occurring at multiple redox
 potentials were analyzed.
 These two species were

 and

.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the abundance of both species at different redox potentials.
 A Shapiro-Wilk normality test shows that both species have a significant
 probability of not following a normal distribution (

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study makes a strong case that soil redox potential cannot be used
 to predict species abundances, for both

 and

Nereis diversicolor
\shape default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As 
\shape italic
Hydrobia ulvae
\shape default
 is an epibenthic grazer (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Newell1965"

\end_inset

), it seems rather obvious that is not influenced by the oxygen level of
 the soil underneath it.
 Less obvious is that individuals were found in benthos 5 cm below the surface.
 This finding appears not to be an experimental error, as 
\shape italic
Hydrobia ulvae
\shape default
 is found in deeper soil samples at multiple distances.
 It might be that the 
\shape italic
Hydrobia ulvae
\shape default
 found in the deeper soil were not individuals, but only the shells left.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Nereis diversicolor
\shape default
 creates burrows in the mud and is a predator and scavanger (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Witte1979"

\end_inset

).
 As it does not live in the soil itself, nor does it feed on something in
 the soil itself, it is not surprising that also this species is unaffected
 by soil redox potential.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coupling a redox potential at a single depth to species abundances at a
 range of depths may have been too much of a simplification.
 Redox potential changes when probing at different depths in the soil, but
 whether this change is monotonous was unknown.
 After drawing the conclusions, the change of redox potential was analyzed
 for its orderedness.
 Because in the experiments also the redox potential at 5 cm deep was measured,
 it could be tested if redox potential changes monotonously for depths 2,
 5 and 10 cm.
 It was found that this was the case in 10 out of 13 locations (see table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Orderedness"

\end_inset

).
 Thus, in 3 out of 13 cases, the redox potential at intermediate depth was
 the heighest or lowest value measured at that location.
 There can be two explanations for this unexpected pattern: (1) the soil
 redox potential is a complex abiotic variable that does not follow a monotonic
 change, or (2) the noise in the redox measurement is higher than the change
 in 'true' redox potential between depths.
